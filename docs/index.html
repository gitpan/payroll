<h2>Perl Payroll modules</h2>
<p>
Payroll is a series of Perl Modules that provides an API for working with
multiple countries federal, state and local taxes.  It also supports calculating
mileage reimbursement values and can handle adjustment entries.
</p>
<p>
The Payroll module starts with an xml document in the Input format and if 
everything is successfull, outputs the results in the Output XML format.

</p>
<p>
Currently only the US is supported and MO is the only supported state.  We are
not supporting any cities in MO yet.  Federal Income, FICA, Medicare and 
Mileage Rates are all being calculated.  We take into account the number of
allowances people can claim and the fact that you can withhold more for 
federal and state.

</p>
<p>
Federal Income tables are only available for any date >= 07/01/2001.

</p>
<p>
See the payroll_test.pl script and input.xml file for a sample implementation.
</p>
<p>
Use process_payroll (in the /usr/bin directory after an rpm install, otherwise
in your perl tree) to actually process payroll files for real.
</p>
<p>
process_payroll will take the specified raw xml file and process it.  If no
errors occured, then you get the result on stdout.  If you specify 2 file names
the result will go into the second file.  You can specify - (for the first file)
and it will know to work with stdin.  I.e.  you can pipe the file to be 
processed.  Ex. 'cat input.xml | process_payroll -' would process input.xml from
the stdin and then output the result to stdout.
</p>
<p>You can download the modules as a <a href="payroll-0.3.tar.gz">tarball</a>.  
We will try to get them on CPAN.</p>
